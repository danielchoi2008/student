We decided on a topic to base this project around on, which was video games. Once the topic was decided, our team communicated effectively to deliver the project.\n",

    "MY ROLE: My role in this project was to develop solutions to any problems that may have caused the code to not work as intended. For instance, some of the lines were not read in script due to a typo or by leaving something out. I also worked with if/else and try/catch statements to show comments and code logic."
